# Training

## Prerequisites
You must have a preprocessed dataset in order to begin training. View the [data preprocessing documentation](/docs/data_preprocessing.md) for more info. 

## Running the Preprocessor
Once you have preprocessed your dataset, you can run start a training run using the command below:
```bash
python -m ClipCap.train --help
```

Running the command with `--help` provides extensive documentation for each individual argument. Alternatively, you can view the [train/args.py file](/ClipCap/train/args.py). However note that some arguments may be found in some other files, such as the [model/args.py file](/ClipCap/model/args.py).

## Example
```bash
TODO
```
